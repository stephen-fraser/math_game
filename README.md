This is a two player commmand line math game created in Ruby.

Players will enter their name and be asked a series of math questions consistening of addition, subtraction, multiplication and modulus operators.

Once one of the players answer's three questions incorrectly the game ends.

This mini-project was completed as part of the Lighthouse Labs Web Developer Program.
